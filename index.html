            <h3>Spread Positivity Like Fragrance</h3>
            <p>Believe deep down in your heart that you're destined to do great things. One small positive thought can
                change your whole day.
                No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit for doing it.
                Always stay true to yourself and never sacrifice who are you for anyone.Miracles happen to those who
                believe
                in them.
                Let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not. You can, you should, and if you’re
                brave
                enough to start, you will.
                Victory is in having done your best. If you’ve done your best, you’ve won. One person can make a
                difference,
                and everyone should try.</p>

            <p> Positive thinking is a belief, a mental attitude that admits into the mind thoughts, words and images
                that
                good things will happen and that one’s efforts will be crowned with success. Positive thinking is
                opposed to
                negative thinking which harbours the mind through thoughts on apprehensiveness, fearfulness, and
                unsure of success in efforts.
                Positive thinking is a reflexive attitude developed or imbibed overtime that pushes you
                to expect fair and desired results. The power of positivity is to create, reinforce, and transform
                energy
                into reality with the mindset to seek a healthy and happy ending regardless of the situation.

        <h1>What Makes You Positive Thinker</h1>
        <div class="flexible-container">
            <div class="positivity-item">
                <h1 class="color-fun">Embrace Every Flow</h1>
                <p>Embracing your flaws is about accepting that everyone is fallible and that it's nonetheless possible
                    to
                    be lovable,
                    good and successful. That isn't to say you should give up on self-improvement and personal
                    development,
                    citing as an excuse
                    that “nobody is perfect”. Rather, the thought is that you should be kinder to yourself about the
                    things
                    that
                    don't go so well in life, the issues you struggle with and the skills you can't quite seem to
                    master.
                    Everyone on earth has
                    imperfections, but sometimes this is extremely hard to accept. And if you are myopically focused on
                    your
                    flaws in this way,
                    it's tough to be happy or to find any lasting sense of success. You create a vicious cycle of
                    self-loathing.
                </p>

            <div class="positivity-item">
                <h1 class="color-fun">Only See Good</h1>
                <p>
                    Seeing the good in people definitely comes with some consequences. You're more vulnerable to getting
                    hurt, to being disappointed,
                    and to being taken advantage of. Sometimes, you expect things of people, and they aren't able or
                    willing
                    to meet those expectations.
                    You want to believe everyone is inherently good, but you have to be honest with yourself in
                    admitting
                    that's not always the case.
                    That doesn't mean you have to stop looking for that good. You learn from it and you expect it the
                    next
                    time, but you should never
                    stop believing that people are capable of redeeming themselves. That choosing to understand rather
                    than
                    run away makes you a person of empathy,
                    a person that people feel comfortable coming to, and a person that's willing to see the good despite
                    the
                    possibility that you could get hurt.
